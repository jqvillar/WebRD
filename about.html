                    I’m glad you came! As the front page shows my name is Janine Villareal, and I aspire to be a UI/UX Designer. 
                    Before I get to why I aspire to be one, I want to tell you my story. 
                    So, I’m a graduate from the University of Calgary with a concentration in Software Engineering. 
                    To be honest, after graduation I was lost. I felt that I had learned so much, yet I knew nothing. 
                    Feeling overwhelmed with the idea of having to, “adult” and facing the pressures of having to find a job quickly, 
                    I decided to leave it all behind and travel.
                </p>   
                <p class="general-text">
                    I decided to travel to London, France, and Germany and throughout my travels I started to realize what I enjoyed about life, 
                    I enjoyed doing, and I’m passionate about. I realized that I’m passionate about people. 
                    Connecting with them, learning from them, hearing their stories, and helping them. Equiped with new experiences, 
                    I made a pact with myself to find a way to incorporate what I had learned in university with what I enjoyed and are passionate about. 
                    This eventually lead me to UX/UI design.
                </p>
                <p class="general-text">
                    What I love most about UX/UI Design (especially UX Desgin) is the ability to give the user a good experience. 
                    Being able to spread enjoyment without directly being there and also connecting with them in a digital space. 
                    As someone who has worked many years in customer service, when someone tells you that their day hasn’t been the 
                    best but with your service you managed to help uplift their mood, you can’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.  
                    I value and am passionate about learning and as a UX/UI Designer you’re able to connect with people and gain insight into how they think, 
                    through activities like user reasearch and user interviews. They’re teaching you what they know, what their challenges are, and how they do things, just to name a few. 
                    Moreover, I also value creativity and being a UX/UI Designer I believe that you are given an opportunity to be creative, think outside of the norm in order to solve business problems, 
                    take part in value creation but also respresent the user and give them the best experience possible. Almost like being the bridge between the business and the users.
